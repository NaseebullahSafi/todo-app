```
Open app on port ![8081](http://localhost:8081/)

### Unit Testing
To start unit testing:
```
yarn test       # Will fireup jest unit testing

## Deployment

## Task
The functional requirements of the application are as follows:
- List all existing todos
- Create a todo
- Update/Edit a todo
- 'Record' button which will record the action taken by the user. i.e. created/deleted/updated a todo
- 'Stop Recording' button which will stop the recording
- 'Clear Recording' button which will clear whatever has been recorded
- 'Play Recording' button which will start playing with the following actions
  - Clear all items from the app
  - Start adding the todo items from the point where user start recording, in correct order.

## Todo
Each Todo item is defined as an object with the following props:

```js
TODO: {
  id          : String,
  name        : String,
  description : String,
  date        : String
}
```
