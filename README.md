## Getting Started
To start the app:
```
git clone https://github.com/NaseebullahSafi/todo-app.git
cd todo-app     # Change directory 
npm i -g yarn   # Optional: I like using yarn
yarn            # Will install dependencies
yarn start      # Will fireup the app
```
Open app on port [8081](http://localhost:8081/)

### Unit Testing
To start unit testing:
```
yarn test       # Will fireup jest unit testing
```
## Deployment
The app is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and CI/CD pipelined using [Travis](https://travis-ci.com/)

## Task
The functional requirements of the application are as follows:
- List all existing todos
- Create a todo
- Update/Edit a todo
- 'Record' button which will record the action taken by the user. i.e. created/deleted/updated a todo
- 'Stop Recording' button which will stop the recording
- 'Clear Recording' button which will clear whatever has been recorded
- 'Play Recording' button which will start playing with the following actions
  - Clear all items from the app
  - Start adding the todo items from the point where user start recording, in correct order.

## Todo
Each Todo item is defined as an object with the following props:

```js
TODO: {
  id          : String,
  name        : String,
  description : String,
  date        : String
}
```
